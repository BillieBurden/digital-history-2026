The dataset was compiled by the Washington Post and then published on GitHub through one of their investigative data reporters, Andrew Ba Tran. The data comes from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report Vol. II and the Washington Post’s year-long investigation of the boarding schools. The DOI’s research goals were to investigate “the loss of human life and lasting consequences of the Federal Indian boarding school system” and to “assist in the effort to recover the histories of these institutions” (Newland 9). Whereas the Post created this file and others to “facilitate additional research” (Hedgpeth).

Each row is a record for one Indian boarding school. The columns then list the details for that school: its name and state, its years of operation, the specific Tribes that attended, and any other names the school used. There are also counts for the deceased people and burial sites found by both the DOI and the Washington Post, with notes on whether those graves were onsite (at the school) or off-site (in another cemetery). Finally, each row has the school's exact latitude and longitude coordinates and a note on whether the location was verified.

There are many limitations to this dataset and the overall research. The DOI report acknowledges that its count of 973 deaths is incomplete because many federal records were destroyed, lost, or never created. More confinements come from the date range of their research. Victims who do not fall between the years of 1819-1969 could get omitted from the data, ultimately narrowing the qualifications for who gets counted and who doesn’t. Additionally, The Washington Post noted that school administrators, such as Richard Henry Pratt at Carlisle, often sent terminally ill children home so their deaths would occur off-campus and not appear on official school registers (Hedgpeth). With a broader view that could show that the perpetrators controlled the validity of the data, leaving children unaccounted for. Another issue arises due to the DOI withholding the names of the children they identified, making it impossible to verify how much their list overlaps with the Post’s larger count. This creates a gap in our ability to cross-reference specific identities. Additionally, the dataset relies on a Western geospatial grid that cannot easily account for lost cemeteries/burial sites. For example, the Post used historical maps to find burial sites that have since been paved over or turned into farmland, such as the soybean field at the Genoa Indian Industrial School.
